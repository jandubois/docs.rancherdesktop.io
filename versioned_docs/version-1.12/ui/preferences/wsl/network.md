### Networking Tunnel

Users can enable or disable the networking tunnel from the `Network` view. After changes are applied, Kubernetes will be restarted. Please see [developer notes](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop-networking) for more information on the experimental Rancher Desktop Network.
